    <string name="text_info_1">This app was created by Nick White from North Florida. I am not a programmer, but an enthusiastic aquarist. I went to school for biology and have been in the hobby for over 10 years.</string>
    <string name="text_info_2">I got tired of having to search for converters every time I wanted to convert meq/L to dKH or determine my new tank’s size. The most commonly used products vary widely in which units are used, and I wanted to create a quick access app to confirm I was dosing the appropriate amount.</string>
    <string name="text_app_errors">Please, inform me of ANY errors. I tried my best to build this app, but I am new to app programming.</string>
    <string name="text_sal_info">-Testing Water Temp is set to 77 °F or 25 °C. Ability to set custom Testing Water Temp is coming!  \n\n-The direct calculation from Salinity (‰ - ppt) to Density (g/l or kg/m3) / Specific Gravity is based on the equation adopted by UNESCO - The One Atmosphere International Equation of the State of Seawater (Millero and Poisson, 1981).  \n\n-The inverse calculation, from Specific Density / Gravity to Salinity, is performed by the solution for iterative methods of the reverse equation of Millero and Poisson.  \n\n-The calculation from Conductivity to Salinity / Density / Gravity Specification is performed according to the complex polynomial equation adopted by UNESCO/ICES/SCOR/IAPSO. In this case,the values are reliable for the resulting salinity between 2 and 42 and a temperature between -2 °C and 35 °C.  \n\n-Salinity values are expressed in Practical Salinity.  \n\n-Thanks to OceanLife.com for providing the source code for the calculations.</string>
    <string name="text_welcome">This App is more than just a simple Unit Converter: It\'s tailored more towards Aquarists or anyone interested in water chemistry. \n\nNot only is there a simple Temperature Converter, but also a Salinity and Alkalinity (KH) converter.  \n\nThere’s also a CO₂ calculator for planted aquariums. Also included are Tank Volume Calculators, which will calculate a tank’s volume in gallons or liters and include its water weight.  \n\nThere will be more to come including specific aquarium parameters, maintenance plans and more!!
