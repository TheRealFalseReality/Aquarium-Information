This App is more than just a simple Unit Converter: It's tailored more towards Aquarists or anyone interested in water chemistry.

Not only is there a simple Temperature Converter, but also a Salinity and Alkalinity (KH) converter.

There’s also a CO₂ calculator for planted aquariums. Also included are Tank Volume Calculators, which will calculate a tank’s volume in gallons or liters and include its water weight.
