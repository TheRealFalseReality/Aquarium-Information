This app was created by Nicholas White from North Florida. I am not a programmer, but an enthusiastic aquarist. I went to school for biology and have been in the hobby for over 10 years.

I got tired of having to search for converters every time I wanted to convert something like meq/L or salinity ppt, and wanted something all in one place. I wanted to solve the problem of not knowing the units that European products use and have quick access to other Aquarium related information in one place.

Please, inform me of ANY errors. I tried my best to build this app, but I am new to app programming.
