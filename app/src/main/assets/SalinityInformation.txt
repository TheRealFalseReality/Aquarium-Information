-Testing Water Temp is set to 77 °F or 25 °C. Ability to set custom Testing Water Temp is coming!

-The direct calculation from Salinity (‰ - ppt) to Density (g/l or kg/m3) / Specific Gravity is based on the equation adopted by UNESCO - The One Atmosphere International Equation of the State of Seawater (Millero and Poisson, 1981).

-The inverse calculation, from Specific Density / Gravity to Salinity, is performed by the solution for iterative methods of the reverse equation of Millero and Poisson.

-The calculation from Conductivity to Salinity / Density / Gravity Specification is performed according to the complex polynomial equation adopted by UNESCO/ICES/SCOR/IAPSO. In this case, the values are reliable for the resulting salinity between 2 and 42 and a temperature between -2 °C and 35 °C.

-Salinity values are expressed in Practical Salinity.
